# EWB Engineering for People Design Challenge – Makers Valley, South Africa

This repository documents my contribution to the EWB Engineering for People Design Challenge, part of LSBU’s Mechanical Engineering program. The challenge was hosted by Engineers Without Borders UK and involved over 13,000 students across four countries.

## 🌍 Project Context
Our team was tasked with developing a sustainable engineering solution for the Makers Valley community in Johannesburg, South Africa. The region faces challenges including poor waste management, high unemployment, and limited access to education.

## 🧠 Design Focus
We selected the “Waste” category and proposed a solution that integrates:
- Waste reduction through upcycled materials
- Job creation via local manufacturing
- Education through packaging embedded with plantable seeds

Our concept: **sustainable, affordable shoes made from local waste**, designed to foster community engagement and environmental care.

## 👥 My Role
- Integrated UN Sustainable Development Goals into the design
- Led concept development and feasibility analysis
- Contributed documentation for final submission

## 🏆 Outcome
- Achieved 96% — highest mark awarded at LSBU
- Selected as a finalist in the international competition
- Praised for innovation, sustainability, and community impact
