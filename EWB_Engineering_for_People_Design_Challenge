# LSBU EWB Design Challenge – Sustainable Footwear for Makers Valley

This repository showcases my contribution as **Team Leader** for LSBU’s Year 1 Design and Practice module. Our team participated in the international **Engineering for People Design Challenge**, hosted by Engineers Without Borders UK, involving over 13,000 students across four countries.

## 🌍 Project Context
We were tasked with developing a sustainable engineering solution for the **Makers Valley** community in Johannesburg, South Africa — a region facing poor waste management, high unemployment, and limited access to education.

## 🧠 Key Contributions
- Led the team through concept development and feasibility analysis
- Integrated UN Sustainable Development Goals into the design
- Proposed sustainable shoes made from local waste materials
- Designed packaging with plantable seeds to promote recycling and environmental care
- Coordinated team roles, documentation, and final presentation
